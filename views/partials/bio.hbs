            Grouplove formed out of a friendship among the five members of the band. Hooper met Zucconi on the Lower East Side of
            Manhattan after hearing music from his former band ALOKE. Despite having just met, Hooper invited Zucconi to an artist
            residency in Crete she was leaving for later that week. It was at the Ikarus artist commune in the village of Avdou
            where they met the rest of the band, Andrew Wessen, Ryan Rabin, and Sean Gadd. Rabin, an accomplished drummer and
            producer, grew up in Los Angeles with Wessen, a surfer and guitarist. Rabin comes from a musical family - his father is
            Trevor Rabin, former guitarist of Yes. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from London, was also at the commune. The
            friendship between the members formed quickly, but the band did not form until a year later after Gadd, Zucconi and
            Hooper pooled their funds together and made a trip to Rabin's Los Angeles recording studio. They played their first show
            at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010. Later that year, the band went on tour with Florence and the Machine on the
            west coast, and then the Joy Formidable on the east coast. By November, Nylon Magazine recognized Grouplove as one of
            the top ten in the "Best New Bands in 2010."
            <br><br>
            Before signing with Canvasback/Atlantic Records the band licensed the song "Getaway Car" to HBO's "How to Make it In
            America". Canvasback re-released their self-titled EP, Grouplove, on January 25, 2011. In 2011, the band co-headlined
            a cross-country tour with Foster the People, and made appearances at Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Reading and Leeds
            Festivals, and Glastonbury.

            love. GROUP", leaving his status with the band up in the air. He has posted a song on YouTube called "Dream With
            Me". On June 19, 2014, Sean Gadd tweeted a series of tweets about his status in the band, the last one officially
